# Financial News Analysis for Stock Trend Prediction

Accurate prediction of stock market trends is crucial for investors, but existing methods often require significant computational resources or lack portability. This study addresses this need by presenting a lightweight and portable system for real-time stock trend prediction based on analysis of financial news articles.

Our system leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable insights from financial news. It utilizes Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key entities within news articles and employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover the underlying topics. This information is then incorporated into a machine learning model for stock trend prediction. Notably, our approach focuses on identifying the most relevant entities and topics within the context of stock market trends, offering a significant advantage over traditional NLP methods in financial prediction.

The proposed NER-based model demonstrates exceptional performance when evaluated on a real-world dataset. We achieve a strong correlation of 0.81 between predicted and actual stock price movements, indicating a robust ability to capture market trends. Furthermore, our model achieves an accuracy score of 96.8%, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in stock trend prediction. This approach offers a promising new direction for leveraging financial news analysis to gain valuable insights into the stock market.
